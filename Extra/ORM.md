📘 ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
ORM is a tool or library that allows you to interact with a database using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

✅ Why Use an ORM?
🔁 Simplifies DB operations
Use intuitive methods like .find() or .save() instead of SQL.

🚀 Improves productivity
Faster development with less boilerplate code.

🧼 Keeps code clean
Interacts with classes/objects—matches your application's structure.

🔄 Cross-database support
Easily switch between databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with minimal changes.

🛠️ Built-in features
Includes migrations, validations, and relationships out of the box.

🧠 In short: ORM helps you manage your database using code, not SQL—making development faster, cleaner, and more scalable.

✅ When to Use ORM
Use ORM when your project has:

🔃 Standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

🧱 Clean architecture / MVC structure

⚡ Quick development goals with minimal boilerplate

📚 Need for features like migrations, validations, and associations

🔄 Plans to switch databases without major rewrites

Example Use Case:
E-commerce sites, SaaS dashboards, admin panels — anything with users, products, orders, etc.

✅ When to Use Native SQL
Use native/raw SQL when:

🔍 You need complex or optimized queries (e.g., joins, subqueries, CTEs)

⚡ You care deeply about performance

🧠 You want full control over indexing, query plans, etc.

🤝 You're working with legacy systems or stored procedures

🔒 You need database-specific features not supported by your ORM

Example Use Case:
Custom reporting systems, analytics engines, high-performance financial systems, data pipelines.

⚖️ Best Practice: Use Both
Use an ORM for 80% of your standard operations, and fall back to raw SQL for complex or performance-critical use cases.
