# TDD (Test Driven Development)

TDD stands for Test-Driven Development.

1. Itâ€™s a software development approach where you:
2. Write tests first (even before writing any real code).
3. Then write just enough code to make the tests pass.
4. Then refactor the code, while keeping tests green.

yarn jest --init
