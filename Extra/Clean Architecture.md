# Clean Architecture

1. A software design pattern.
2. Used to create software systems that are **modular**, **maintainable**, and **independent** of external frameworks, databases, and user interfaces.
3. Organizes the application into **layers**, where the **innermost layer** contains the **most critical business logic**.

For a visual representation, refer to this [Clean Architecture diagram][def].
